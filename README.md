This paper focuses on the improvement of a cloud-based application that predicts the health conditions of the patient daily. patients can check their health status and records are generated and saved in the cloud and can access them by using mobile and web applications. A new era in healthcare has begun with the introduction of technology, promising creative approaches to tracking and forecasting health conditions and status. This study introduces and investigates the “Smart Human Body Health Prediction Application System,” a vast digital platform that combines wearable sensors, and artificial intelligence, to provide real-time health insights and predictive analysis so that the patient can easily know their health and can consult the doctors. The Smart Human Body Health Prediction Application System, which combines wearable sensors, using ML algorithm to train the data sets, and predictive analytics, is explored in detail in this paper. We talk about how these elements work together to give users a proactive and unique approach to the health care field.
